# Tekko


Tekko allows tech newcomers to access salaries insights and  anonymous reviews from real employees.
Users can add, edit,delete and access their reviews in a very simple way with a user-friendly interface (full CRUD).
This website  was coded in 4 days on the fifth week of the IronHack web development bootcamp.
